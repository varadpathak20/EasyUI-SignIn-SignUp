# EasyUI-SignIn-SignUp
A ready to use SignIn and SignUp UI in Swift 3

![alt text](https://github.com/varadpathak20/EasyUI-SignIn-SignUp/blob/master/1.gif)

This UI is devloped by taking inspiration from the UI design created by https://www.uplabs.com/zubkoyaroslav. I was able to make it animate same as https://www.uplabs.com/zubkoyaroslav did. However, I have added my own changes to the UI animations to improve the UX. Yet, there is still a huge room for adding and improving the existing features.

The code already has validations and exception handeling for the textfields.

One can also SET A VIDEO as background. All one has to do is add the video in the bundle and then go in the viewDidLoad() in viewcontroller.swift and set the isBackgroundVideo = true and add the name of his video in the playVideoInBackGround() method in the moviePath.

TO USE this UI simply copy the "Main.storyboard", "Viewcontroller.swift" & "Constants and Extensions.swift" files to your project and rename them accordingy.

Please feel free to contribute to the project.
If you like my work then please do appreciate it, that would go a long way for me and keep me motivated...

Cheers, :)
