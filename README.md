# EasyUI-SignIn-SignUp
A ready to use SignIn and SignUp UI in Swift 3

![alt text](https://github.com/varadpathak20/EasyUI-SignIn-SignUp/blob/master/1.gif)

This UI is devloped by taking inspiration from the UI design created by https://www.uplabs.com/zubkoyaroslav. I was able to make it animate same as https://www.uplabs.com/zubkoyaroslav did. However, I have added my own small changes to the UI animations to inprove the UX. Yet, there is still a huge room for adding and improving the existing features.

The code already has validations and exception handeling for thr textfields.

TO USE this UI simply copy the "Main.storyboard", "Viewcontroller.swift" & "Constants and Extensions.swift" files to your project.

Please feel free to contribute to the project.
If you like my work then please do appreciate it, that would go a long way for me and keep me motivated...

Cheers, :)
